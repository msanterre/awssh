# awssh

## Purpose
*awssh* is a tool that provides simple command line calls to ssh into AWS EC2 instances. It finds out the name and address of the machines and uses that information to ssh into the machines with a short and straightforward command.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/msanterre/awssh
```

## Configuration

This tool uses the basic AWS API environment variables for authentication:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION

## Usage

If this is your first time using it. You should start by syncing

```
$ awssh sync
Syncing ...
Saving: test-1
```

*awssh* makes some assumptions on the type of instance you start. The default name of your instance will be `ubuntu`, which is the default login for ubuntu type machines. (Support for other types will be added upon request)

Now to connect to your instance:
```
$ awssh list
test-1              ubuntu     ec2-51-186-242-255.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

$ awssh connect test-1
Connecting to: ubuntu@ec2-51-186-242-255.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

And you should now be connecting to your machine! ðŸŽ‰
